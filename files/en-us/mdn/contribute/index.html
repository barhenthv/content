<p>MDN Web Docs needs your help! We have a large number of typos to fix, examples to write, bugs to fix, people to talk to, and more, and the number is growing as more people start using the site. If you want to contribute to MDN, a great place to start is by reading some of the short guides linked below to find out what is available for you to do, and how you can do it:</p>

<p><span class="seoSummary">The guides listed here cover all aspects of contributing to MDN, including style guides, guides to using our editor and tools, and more. Please make sure you have read (and are compliant with) the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/mozilla/">Mozilla Terms</a> before editing or creating any pages. </span></p>

<p>If you haven't contributed to MDN previously, the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Getting_started">Getting Started</a> guide can help you pick a task to jump in and help with.</p>

<h2 id="What_can_I_do_to_help">What can I do to help?</h2>

<p>There are multiple avenues you can take to contribute to MDN depending on your skill set and interests. Along with each task we provide a short description, and an approximate time that each type of task typically takes.</p>

<p>If you are not sure what to do, you are always welcome to <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Getting_started#Step_4_Ask_for_help">ask for help</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Primary_contribution_types">Primary contribution types</h3>

<p>The links in this section lead to detailed guides explaining how to do a particular contribution task that we most interested in getting community help with, either because they are a critical function, and/or because they have a large backlog associated with them. Please consider helping out with these tasks before you consider contributing in other ways.</p>

<p>Please give the issue a descriptive title. (It's not helpful to say "Dead link" without saying where you found the link. Pro tip: Most "dead links" on MDN are to articles that haven't been written yet.) Under "Request type", put an "x" in the brackets for "Correction or update" if you found a problem, or for "New documentation" if there's something missing from MDN. Under "Details", provide as much information as you know or have time to describe about the problem and where to find correct information. This can include people ("talk to so-and-so") as well as Web links.</p>

<p>Our sprints repo is where people submit issues to report problems found with MDN docs. We get a lot of these, and any help you can give in fixing them would be much appreciated.</p>

<h2 id="What_do_we_need_help_with">What do we need help with?</h2>

<p>You can see the content issues we have that need fixing on the GitHub project boards listed in the table below. There a huge variety of bugs submitted, from requests to fix typos or inaccurate statements, to requests for entire new reference pages or demos. Whatever your skills set, or time available, we think you'll be able to find something to help with that suits you.</p>

<p>We’d like you to choose a board to help out on, pick some issues, and fix them, helping to improve MDN web docs in the process.</p>

<h2 id="What_skills_do_you_need">What skills do you need?</h2>

<ul>
 <li>You need to be knowledgeable in the topic areas that you choose to help with (e.g. JavaScript, CSS).</li>
 <li>Most of the examples and pages that you will help with are written in English, so you should have a reasonable understanding of the English language. But don't worry if your English is not perfect! Our team are more than happy to help clean up any writing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="How_to_help">How to help</h2>

<ol>
 <li>First of all, sign up for a <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a>, if you don’t already have one.</li>
 <li>Sign up for an MDN account, if you don’t already have one, as explained in <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Getting_started#Step_1_Create_an_account_on_MDN">Create an account on MDN</a>. You can authenticate it using your GitHub account, .</li>
 <li>Next, choose one or more topic areas you’d like to help with. Use the list above to get more information to help you make your selection. If you are not sure what a good choice would be, feel free to email us and ask, at <a href="mailto:mdn-admins@mozilla.org">mdn-admins@mozilla.org</a>. </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Once_you_are_set_up">Once you are set up</h3>

<ol>
 <li>Go to a board and choose an issue to work on that interests you. Note that in the project boards, issues are triaged into high and low priority tasks, and in addition each issue is given a label to estimate the amount of time we think it'll take to fix — the time categories are 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, and multiple hours.</li>
 <li>Write a comment saying that you would like to take this issue, and we'll assign you to it.
  <ol>
   <li>If someone else is already assigned to the issue:
    <ol>
     <li>If this was more than one week ago, and there has not been much activity, @mention them and ask them if you can take it over, or otherwise help get it to completion.
      <ul>
       <li>If they agree for you to take it, we'll assign you to it and remove them.</li>
       <li>If they agree for you to take it and some work has been done already, or the agreement is to help them out with it, we'll assign you to it alongside them.</li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>If it was less than one week ago, then have some patience, and give them a chance to work on it.</li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>If the issue has been marked as complete but needing a review, and you want to review it, @mention them in the comments and say you’ll review it.</li>
 <li>Once you are assigned to an issue, scope out the remainder of the work that needs to be done.
  <ul>
   <li>If the issue is well-described, and the work is pretty obvious, go ahead and do it.</li>
   <li>If the issue is not well-described, and/or you are not sure what is needed, feel free to @mention the poster and ask for more information.</li>
   <li>If you are not still sure who to ask, ask for help at <a href="mailto:mdn-admins@mozilla.org">mdn-admins@mozilla.org</a>.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Once you think you’ve fixed an issue, ask for a review in the comments.</li>
 <li>Once an issue has been successfully reviewed and comments answered, you can mark it as closed.</li>
</ol>

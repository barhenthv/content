<h2 id="General_Rules_and_Etiquette">General Rules and Etiquette</h2>

<p>Once you have your client set up (see software below) and are connected, there are some basic rules you should follow to ensure the most enjoyable and productive experience:</p>

<ol>
 <li>As with all Mozilla forums and events, agreeing to our <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/">Community Participation Guidelines</a> is a requirement for participation.</li>
 <li>Try to keep messages as concise as possible. If you have something long to post, a code snippet for example, use <a href="https://paste.mozilla.org/">paste.mozilla.org</a> and paste the generated URL in IRC instead.</li>
 <li>When addressing someone directly, try to use name: message format. For example, "ashughes: good morning!"</li>
 <li>Every channel has its own topic. Try to keep your messages within that subject matter. For example, do not talk about Thunderbird issues in #Firefox.</li>
 <li>Mozilla's channels are most active between 9am and 7pm PST Monday to Friday, excluding <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/holidays-work-schedules-and-pay/">US Holidays</a>.</li>
 <li>When asking a question, be patient. Sometimes, it can take a few minutes for people to respond.</li>
 <li>Posting a message like "Help!" is not particularly helpful. Asking a good question will result in a better experience for both you and the person trying to help.</li>
 <li><strong>Relax and have fun!</strong></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Software">Software</h2>

<p>There are several different applications which allow you to connect to IRC networks. You will need to use the following information to configure the server connection:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Server: <code>irc.mozilla.org</code></li>
 <li>Port: 6667 (default) or 6697 (SSL)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Desktop_clients">Desktop clients</h3>

<p>Desktop clients tens to allow the most detailed configuration. For example, you can connect using SSL or a non-secure connection, and you can configure the client to automatically connect to a server and join a particular set of channels when you start the client. The following are some other options available to you:</p>

<table class="standard-table">
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td></td>
   <td><strong>Windows</strong></td>
   <td><strong>Mac</strong></td>
   <td><strong>Linux</strong></td>
  </tr>

<p>Key:</p>

<p>● — Binary or executable program available</p>

<p>○ — Only available by downloading and compiling source code</p>

<p>●* — Binary or executable may be available. If not, you'll have to download source code and compile.</p>

<h3 id="Web-based_clients">Web-based clients</h3>

<p>There are also a few web-based clients which allow connecting to IRC by clicking on irc:// links. One of the simplest web-based clients is <a href="https://www.mibbit.com/">Mibbit</a>, another is <a href="https://www.irccloud.com/">IRCCloud</a>. These operate very much in the same way as the previously mentioned desktop clients and ChatZilla. Mibbit does NOT require flash or any other plugins. <a name="channels"></a></p>
